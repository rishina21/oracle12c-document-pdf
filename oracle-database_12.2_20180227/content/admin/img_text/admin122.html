            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>Before upgrade.</p>
                  <p>This step shows an application root labelled “Application Root v1.0.” The application root has three application PDBs plugged into it.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Begin upgrade.</p>
                  <p>This step shows an application root labelled “Application Root v1.0.” The application root has three application PDBs plugged into it. There is an arrow pointing to another application root labelled “Application Root Clone v1.0.”</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>End upgrade.</p>
                  <p>This step shows an application root labelled “Application Root v2.0.” There is another application root labelled “Application Root Clone v1.0.” The application root labelled “Application Root Clone v1.0.” has three application PDBs plugged into it.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>After synchronization.</p>
                  <p>This step shows an application root labelled “Application Root v2.0.”  There is another application root labelled “Application Root Clone v1.0.” The application root labelled “Application Root v2.0.” has two synchronized application PDBs plugged into it. The application root labelled “Application Root Clone v1.0.” has one application PDB plugged into it.</p>
               </li>
